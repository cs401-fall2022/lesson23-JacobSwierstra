## Experience

- Were there any things that you struggled with? 
The biggest thing that I struggled with in this final project was the formatting of the data from the sql table.
it took me a long time to figure out how I can put formatting on the data. the other big thing I struggled with 
was the delete button. where after you delete a blog entry it would continue to count up. EX you have 1,2,3,7,8 
and you go to delete entry 8. the next added blog would be 9 even though the data shows, 1,2,3,7. To fix this 
where it would make the next added entry go to the next biggest number, I had to run another sql command that 
updated the seq to the highest number of blog_id. after every deletion. this also had some issues because of the 
way that it was returning the query, eventually I got everything to work correctly
I would not say that any parts of this project were unclear because it was a general topic and we had free rein 
to make the webpage look how we wanted it to look. I was able to finish the entire project in time.
